<h3>Neural network classifier implemented in chainer</h3>
(Draft)

Different architectures can be specified: 
  - varying dimensions for convolution, 
  - number of convolutional layers, 
  - kernel size,
  - number of kernels, 
  - use batch normalization or not, 
  - amount of weight decay
  - details of training.
